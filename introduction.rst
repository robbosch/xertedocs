Introduction
============
We are currently reviewing our documentation to fully reflect the changes we that have taken place since v3.
This project contains links to a number of guides. Please note, many of these are older guides so are
likely to contain some differences to your own version of Xerte Online Toolkits if you are running v3+.
They are still mostly useful and relevant especially if you are new to Xerte. The look and feel and some
features may have changed but the general steps and guidance is still valid.

We will update the guides linked from this project as we produce new documentation.
How you start with Xerte depends on who you are - select the title most suited to your role to view relevant help.
