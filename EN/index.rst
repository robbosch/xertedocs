.. Xerte documentation master file

Introduction
============
We are currently reviewing our documentation to fully reflect the changes we that have taken place since v3.
This project contains links to a number of guides. Please note, many of these are older guides so are
likely to contain some differences to your own version of Xerte Online Toolkits if you are running v3+.
They are still mostly useful and relevant especially if you are new to Xerte. The look and feel and some
features may have changed but the general steps and guidance is still valid.

We will update the guides linked from this project as we produce new documentation.
How you start with Xerte depends on who you are - select the title most suited to your role to view relevant help.

`Guide to Getting Started <https://xot.xerte.org.uk/play.php?template_id=150>`_
This guide includes an overview of the Xerte interface, details on how to create and edit projects and
instructions for releasing the finished content to students.

`An Author's Guide to Accessibility <https://xot.xerte.org.uk/play.php?template_id=153>`_
This guide gives an overview of basic accessibility considerations, detailed information relating to the needs
of users with a variety of specific needs and instructions for adding many of the recommended accessibility
features to a Xerte project. The guidance covers both technical accessibility and pedagogical hints and tips.

`Variables Guide <https://xot.xerte.org.uk/USER-FILES/156-fay-Nottingham/media/Variables_Documentation.pdf>`_
This guide covers how to set up variables and use them in your projects. Variables can be used to add variety
to the data that students are shown as the value of each variable is calculated (according to the parameters
set by the author) when the project is viewed. For example, instead of including the sum 1 + 2 = 3, variables
allow the sum a + b = c to use a variety of numbers.

Although several years old, the following 2013 guides by Jisc TechDis should be of use when you start using Xerte:

`Creating Your First Learning Object <http://training.mitchellmedia.co.uk/xot/USER-FILES/78-ronm-site//media/Xerte_FirstLOTut_2011.pdf>`_
In this tutorial we will begin to create a simple learning object containing some text, images and sound.
In the process we will explore the basics of the Xerte Online Toolkits interface and the steps required to
create and share your first learning object.

When creating or editing a project based on the Xerte Online Toolkit template, there are many page types to
choose from. Although a preview and summary is provided within the project editor window itself, the more
detailed summary and reference to each page type provided in this guide can serve as either an introduction
to, or reminder of, what’s available and help us to choose which page type to use for a specific purpose.
